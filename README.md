# Gaze-Gesture

The project focus on tackling Shoulder Surfing Attacks.

<ins>Shoulder Surfing attacks</ins>: <br>
It is a type of social engineering technique used to obtain information such as personal identification numbers, passwords and other confidential data by looking over the victim's shoulder.

<ins>How does this project tackles it?</ins>: 
<br>
In this project, the victim/user has to select the password/numbers by just blinking.

Its a 2 Factor authentication system, where the first factor is just like common, login & registrations. For the next factor, the user has to define a four digit number, where each digit is in range of 0-4. Now, at the time of login, the first stage is the normal username and password, the next stage is where the project mainly targets.
The user has to blink and select the password, in the same pattern in which he/she had defined the 4 digit password for the GAZE factor authentication.

<ins>Who are behind this project?</ins>
<br>
We are a group of 4, namely VAMS group, who are in the final year of engineering, Computer Branch students. This project, is our final year topic and we are exploring more things of every field of computer engineering.

<ins>Does this project works?</ins>
<br>
Our group has tested it from my side, so we can assure, around 85 - 90 % it should work properly.

<ins>How can you run it?</ins>

Its too simple!!!!

1. Download/Clone the project
2. Go inside your project folder, open terminal/command prompt
3. Type ``` python manage.py runserver ```
